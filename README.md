# Gridworld
/**
GridWorld is a project whose base code, as well as a handbook full of projects to try, is given out by the College Board. The GridWorld code comes with the main GUI, as well as the code for a basic code for a Bug (moves forward), Critter (eats bugs), Rock (does nothing), Flower (grows and wilts), and Actor (spins). Using this base code, I was able to create several elements assigned from the handbook, including:

DancingBug- Like a normal bug, but whenever it moves to a new grid location it spins around a set number of times
Figure8Bug- It walks around in a figure-eight
ZBug- I walks around in Z-shaped patterns
OctagonBug- It walks around in an octagon
SpiralBug- It walks around in a spiral
BlusterCritter- Changes color when bugs are nearby
ChameleonCritter- Interacts with rocks and flowers by changing to the color of the nearest one
QuickCrab- Only moves sideways, but 2 spaces per step. They also eat bugs.
AntFarm- A project consisting of regular ants, food elements, and a queen ant, in which the ants deliver food to the queen.

Some additional non-assigned projects I worked on, some of which I couldn’t find my old code for:

EvilQueen- Like the normal queen, except if a bug walks by her without food the bug is removed from the grid
PoliceBug- In a world where ant food is a controlled substance, if a bug with food passes by the PoliceBug, the PoliceBug escorts them off of the grid
SpinningFood- Like normal food but it spins

While acquiring the code and screenshots for this portfolio I had to do a lot of re-learning of Eclipse, and a bit of re-coding, to get the code to function, since Eclipse only wanted to run GridWorld using AntBuild. Though AntBuild sounds fitting for this particular project, it’s not. After a couple hours of fumbling with source folders and code it all came together.
